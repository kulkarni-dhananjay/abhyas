We are throwing a party! But we have to first figure out whom to invite.
We have n people to choose from and we also have a list of which pairs of 
people that know each other. Assume that if person A knows person B, then 
person B also knows person A. We would like to invite as many people as 
possible subject to the following constraint: each person at the party 
needs to know at least five people that are also attending the party.

Implement an algorithm in Java that takes a list of people, and a list of
pairs of people that know each other. The goal is to output the list of 
people that we should invite to the party. 

You can represent this information any way you want, but we will be 
evaluating the code for both correctness and style. For this problem 
you should emphasize style over efficiency.
